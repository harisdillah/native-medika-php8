How to Fix It
Check the Existing Users in MySQL: You can confirm if root@% exists by logging into MySQL and running:

sql
Salin kode
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
Look for root with % as the host. If it’s not there, you’ll need to add it.

Create or Grant Permissions to root@%: If root@% does not exist, create it with the required privileges:

sql
Salin kode
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Replace your_password with a secure password for the root user.

Modify the Definer in the SQL Code: If root@% is unnecessary, you can change the definer in stored procedures, triggers, or events to another valid user, such as root@localhost. Use a query like this:

sql
Salin kode
ALTER DEFINER = 'root'@'localhost' PROCEDURE procedure_name;



CREATE TABLE data_users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'pending') NOT NULL
);
